### **Description**

This laboratory activity focuses on exploring digital signals through hands-on experimentation using an Arduino microcontroller. It demonstrates the operation of digital signals by utilizing binary states (HIGH and LOW), observing signal transitions, and applying timing control.

The behavior of digital outputs in real-world electronic systems is illustrated by controlling multiple LEDs connected to digital pins. Through this setup, the activity reinforces essential foundational concepts, including:

* Binary logic
* Digital signal transitions
* Output pin configuration
* Timing and sequencing in digital systems

These concepts are fundamental for understanding how sensors, actuators, and controllers interact within Internet of Things (IoT) environments.

### **Activity Overview**

The Arduino program performs the following tasks:

* Sets multiple digital pins as output pins
* Sequentially turns LEDs ON using a fixed delay
* Sequentially turns LEDs OFF using the same delay
* Continuously repeats the process through the `loop()` function

This sequence provides a clear and visible demonstration of how digital signals change over time.
